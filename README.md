# PCM App

## Code

This project utilizes [Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript) and [indy-sdk-react-native](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk-react-native).

## Project State

### Platform

PCM currently is built on React Native 0.66.4

As of now PCM targets Android API 30.0.2

iOS targets iOS 10.0+.PCM can only be run on physical devices as of right now.

## Install

1. React Native Setup:
   - React Native installation instructions are documented [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
   - (iOS) Install [Cocoa Pods](https://cocoapods.org/)
2. Clone the PCM repo and install its dependencies:
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/pcm/app.git
   yarn install
   ```
3. (iOS) iOS specific install:
   - Install iOS Pods:
     ```sh
     cd ios
     pod install
     ```
   - In the /ios directory, open the project workspace file in Xcode.
     Once the project is open, navigate to the project's Signing & Capabilities tab and apply your personal Apple Developer Account or your organization's team to target PCM 
   - Adjust the bundle identifier if needed.

## Configure

In the root directory add an `.env.development` file containing:
MEDIATOR_URL=https://www.example.com/mediator


## Run

- Launch the metro bundler:
  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```
- Open a second terminal and run:
  - (Android)
    ```sh
    yarn android:dev
    ```
  - (iOS)
    ```sh
    yarn ios:dev
    ```
  - (iOS) Via Xcode:
    Choose your physical iOS device as the destination. Click the "Play" button to Build and Run.

**NOTE: PCM does not work on iOS simulators** -- use a physical device instead.

### Advanced Configuration

#### Mediator

In order to use PCM, you must have a mediator to use with the app. PCM is configured to use 'Implicit' mediation and requires a mediator that supports the [coordinate-mediation protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0211-route-coordination).

## Troubleshooting

#### Hot Reloading

Hot reloading may not work correctly with instantiated Agent objects. Reloading (`r`) or reopening the app may work. Any changes made to native modules require you to re-run the compile step.

### Dependency Issues, Native Module Linking Issues, or Usage Issues

If you end up changing dependencies or structures, you may need to perform the following steps:

#### Android

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

Clean the Android build:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

Start and clean the Metro cache:

```sh
yarn start
```

In your second terminal, you can now run:

```sh
yarn android
```

## Building local android apk file in debug mode

Create .env file with environment variables

Run command in root folder of app project

```sh
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```

Go to path `android` and run the command

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

As a result you will get apk file in `./android/app/build/outputs/apk/[production|development]`


## How to prepare next application android release

Put correct password for android upload key in the file `android/gradle.properties` for `MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD` and `MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD`

Run command in root folder of app project

```sh
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```

Go to path `android` and run the command

```sh
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

After that you will find `app-release.aab` file in `./android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release` folder

## Useful commends

`./gradlew signingReport` - In order to find out what's wrong with apk signing you can use gradle's signingReport command.
